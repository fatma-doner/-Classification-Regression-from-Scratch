# Applied Machine Learning Projects ‚Äî METU MTH221

Welcome! üëã  
This repository contains my solutions to two machine learning assignments completed for the MTH221 course at METU. These assignments explore both fundamental and advanced ML concepts, including model building, evaluation, and deep learning techniques.
