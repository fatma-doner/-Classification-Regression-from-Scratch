# -Classification-Regression-from-Scratch
This repository contains my solution to a machine learning assignment for the MTH221 course at METU.  
It includes two main projects:

1. **Classification Problem** using a real-world weather dataset
2. **Gradient Descent Implementation** for regression, written entirely from scratch using only NumPy and Pandas

## 📂 Contents

- `METU_Assignment_1.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with all implementations and explanations

## 🧠 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Part 1: Classification

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)
- K-Fold Cross Validation
- Algorithms implemented:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Perceptron
  - Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - ROC-AUC

### 🔹 Part 2: Regression with Gradient Descent

- Manual implementation of Gradient Descent
- Cost function optimization with different learning rates
- Convergence visualization
- Performance analysis for multiple α (0.01, 0.1, 1)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for EDA & plots)
- scikit-learn (only in Part 1)

> **Note:** Gradient Descent in Part 2 is implemented entirely without any ML libraries.
